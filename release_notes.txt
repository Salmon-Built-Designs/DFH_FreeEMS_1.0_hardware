--- Release notes, more at http://www.diyefi.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=333
A.21 Connected injector and ignition sub circuits to TA pins. Fixed a number of issues found in other spins S12X spins. Changed several component values, like the LED's include a resistor, so the orginal current limiting resistor can be a diode with better reverse polarity protection, and changed AN filter ciruits to 470R per Fred's empirical tests.
A.20 Not working yet, but very close to beta, now includes a orderable BOM, still needs traces from CPU to circuits
A.19 basically done, needs traces run from the CPU to the circuits, PCB is ready for review
A.18 oops, for got to fill this in
A.17 All major PCB circuits are layed out. This layout is easy to copy and paste, 
this layout is likely the best to copy if significant changes are needed in the future
A.16 Added more to the PCB layout, most complicated circuits are PCB drafted, and reviews 
seem to have stopped, so schematics are likely final.
A.15 Added and fixed some schematic items, created first draft PCB layout.
A.14 more tweaking, we have to be getting close to PCB layout now.
A.12 foot prints are selected, pending review it's ready to move to PCB layout
A.11 Most footprints are selected, need footprints for caps, a mosfet, and connectors. 
After that it can enter the PCB layout.
A.09 basic overview
- Can generate netlist from schematic almost ready to go to PCB
- schematic contains most required parts and has been checked by a handful of people
