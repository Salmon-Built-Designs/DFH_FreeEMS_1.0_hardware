A.21 P.02
- changed VR from LM chip, to MAX chip via JBPerf board.

A.21 P.01
- Connected injector and ignition sub circuits to TA pins. 
- Fixed a number of issues found in other spins S12X spins. 
- Changed several component values, like the LED's include a resistor, so the orginal current limiting resistor can be a diode with better reverse polarity protection, and changed AN filter ciruits to 470R per Fred's empirical tests.
- Removed hacked attempt at current sensing the injectors.
- Fixed some issues with the project properties, like trace width specs, and library location(s).
- Changed licence from TAPR to MIT.

A.20 P.01
- added at least one vendor for each required part or most parts
- recreated BOMs, netlists, and such files
- created xls boms, and PDF boms that copy well to newarks "quick paste" feature
- added release check list

A.19 P.02
- fixed silk screen that out lines the sections
- added freeEMS 1.0 A.XX to component layer for ID
- added dims to board size

A.19 P.01
- moved ignition and injection around to make room for run ways
- deleted extra an protect
- moved many traces on the PCB

A.18 P.01
- copied the ignition, and injection drivers
- added 3D to TA card
- deleted LED's because there isn't room on PCB
- jumpered injector current sense inductor 0R
- jumpered temp sensor FETs
- changed injector footprints from pins to pintst (smaller hole)

A.17 P.01
- changed connection in RPM input schematic for correct op-amp side of a resistor
- changed 74hc86 to normal package, no hidden pins
- all major circuits are layed out, ready for final merging on the board.

A.16
- changed labels for VCC to VCC_SW and VCC_CNT for switched or constant.This still needs work, but got me going again
- added draft RPM PCB layouts, 
- moved TA card 90 degrees
- changed U8 and U10 to U8A and U8B, for the duel op-amp one package deal.
- A bunch of other stuff changed I'm sure, but that's the big stuff above.

A.15
- added TO220-sm footprint to ignition driver chip
- fixed signal path on MAP symbol, was power out, is now bidi.
- cleanup for ERC checking like fixing RPM_0_input to RPM_2_input, at RPM digi input sheet
- created symbol 7805-diyefi to prevent the usage of power-in and power-out features
- mirrored the power reg schematic for easier readability
- added hall op-amp buffer / filter
- corrected footprints to have SMD devices on component layer
- created draft of ignition drirver, injector driver, V regs, and over all layout in PCB.

A.14 
- deleted zener from power reg
- added resistor to input on LM1815, removed 1k switch resistor, apparently wasn't the one Fred talked about
- add 1.6K to the ignition driver outputs before the XOR's.
- added 2nd switched 12V, where does it go?
- added schematic names to title block to help navigate the top level.

A.13
- changed temp resistor to 2.7k
- changed LED resistors to 3k
- corrected ind_dr_0 to 5 now ind_dr_1 to 6
- removed resistor on RPM sensor 12V to sense, added 0R jumper
- changed signal select on ignition schematic to resemble RPM select.
- added drain resistor to ignition FET.

A.12
- changed convert.sh to convert-ps2pdf.sh for clarity. 
- added footprint to caps and other components
- changed connectors to 1pin devices,will deal with connectors at the PCB level.
- added XOR for inversion / buffering as required
- added output LED's to injectors, ignition, and general outputs.

A.11
- added 5v path to the ignition driver
- added/changed R4-sm0805, D4-SM0805, D4-SMB, FUSE5-20-DEFAULT-10A foot print(s)
- added "field" properties to most components like resistor and diodes, including info like footprint to the schematic symbols. Still need ignition fet footprint, cap's, and connector footprints.
- will design with traces defaulting to 6 mils (1.5mm) for 1 amp draw per online calculator external PCB trace


A.10
- changed 2k on injector drivers to 2.2 to make similar values
- added values to MAP caps.
- cleaned up values for other components to maintain consistency
- deleted 2 extra maps, called for 4 maps total now calls for 2
- added 12v fuse(s) 2A regulators and 10A other
- moved license to a folder so I don't delete it by mistake

A.09
- added the change log and future steps log
- fixed injector drives again, this time it saved correctly
- changed 70R to 2K
- ran BOM tool to generate a BOM called freeEMS_1.lst
- semi automated template convert process, now edit the tempates, then run convert-template.sh to get the real schematics
- added footprint to many resistors
- change VR circuit some
