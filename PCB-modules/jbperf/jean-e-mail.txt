I don't have any KICAD information for this but using the picture 
attached and using the upper left corner as my origin and mils as the 
units (so turn the picture 90 degrees counterclockwise to get the 
correct axis),  you have a mounting hole at 125,150, the first pad 
(Out1) is at 300,125 then the other pads are at 400,125;500,125;600,125 
(Out2, 12V, Ground). The other mounting hole is at 575,950, and the pads 
are at 100,975;200,975;300,975;400,975 (VR1+, VR1-, VR2-, VR2+).

And the board is 700x1100. The mounting holes have a 125mil diameter. 
The pads drill size is larger than for standard pin headers to 
accommodate wires so there will be some play when used with pin headers 
but that should not be a problem.
